- Queue -- In minimum steps where each solution are stored
- Recursion -- Used to iterate through steps

- Backtrakking -- Used to go back if game is dead

Breif Description:
Knights tour is a famous chess problem where a knight has to move to all squares without repeating. Backtrackking was used along with a herustic known as Warnsdroff algorithm which sets a rule that knight must move to a square from which it can go to least unvisited squares. Since warnsdroff isn't a sure shot solution, it is combined with backtrackking.
